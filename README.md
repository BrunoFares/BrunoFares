👋 Hi, I'm Bruno

🎓I'm a third year Computer Science student at Notre Dame University - Louaize, Lebanon.

👨🏻‍💻I'm interested in everything related to computers, as in my free time from university work, I like to dabble in front-end web development, and I post the projects I complete on this page.

🤖I don't set limitations to myself though, I always like to learn new skills in a wide variety of fields, like in the field of artificial intelligence through Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence using Python for example. 

🫡Welcome to my playground!
