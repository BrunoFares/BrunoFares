ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bruno Fares

I'm a second year Computer Science student at Notre Dame University - Louaize, Lebanon.
I'm interested in everything related to computers, as in my free time from university work, I like to dabble in front-end web development using the React framework, and I post the projects I complete on this page. 

Welcome to my playground!
