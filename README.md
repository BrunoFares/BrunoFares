ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bruno Fares

I'm a second year Computer Science student at Notre Dame University - Louaize, Lebanon.

I'm interested in everything related to computers, as in my free time from university work, I like to dabble in front-end web development, and I post the projects I complete on this page.

I don't set limitations to myself though, I always like to learn new skills in a wide variety of fields, like in machine learning or data science for example. 

Welcome to my playground!
